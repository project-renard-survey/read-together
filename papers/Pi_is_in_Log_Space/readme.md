# Meeting

Thursday 7pm EST 2020-05-21 to discuss Pi is in Log Space.

Anyone is free to participate, useful background includes
- Algorithms
- Number theory
- Analysis

## Persistent asynchronous channel

We are using IRC: `#readtogether` on `irc.freenode.net`

I will be using `logBot.py` to log conversations on the `#readtogether` channel.

## Ephemeral synchronous channel

Latex: [CodiMD](https://demo.codimd.org/ejCcijwSQUa1p0v1DoIeCg#)

## Goal

Understand the main argument of the proof and gain familiarity with tools used.

Concrete manifestation as:
- Meeting notes
- Small demos of tool use
- Implementations of algorithm (ranging from sketch to something more complete)
